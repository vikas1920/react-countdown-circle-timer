# Change Log

## 2.0.0

**Implemented enhancements:**

- Make the repo monorepo handled by Lerna
- Breaking changes:
  - Remove the old `startAt` prop. The recommended prop to use is `initialRemainingTime` instead.
  - Remove `margin` styles from the wrapper and all svg styles
  - `durationSeconds` is renamed to just `duration`. The duration is still in **seconds**
  - `renderTime` prop is now deprecated. React `children` should be used instead. The `children` prop accepts a render function or a component where `remainingTime` and `elapsedTime` are passed as props.
  - `renderAriaTime` prop will receive as an argument an object with the `remainingTime` and `elapsedTime`
